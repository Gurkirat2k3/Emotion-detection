# Emotion-detection
A Python-based project that detects human emotions in real-time using facial expressions. This application utilizes computer vision and deep learning techniques to recognize emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more.

🔍 Features
Real-time emotion detection using webcam

Pre-trained deep learning models for emotion classification

Face detection using OpenCV or similar libraries

Easy-to-use and customizable Python code

Option to visualize emotion probabilities with confidence scores

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

Pre-trained CNN model (e.g., FER2013 dataset)
