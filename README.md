Pre-trained deep learning models for emotion classification

Face detection using OpenCV or similar libraries

Easy-to-use and customizable Python code

Option to visualize emotion probabilities with confidence scores

üß† Technologies Used
Python

OpenCV

TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch

NumPy

Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

Pre-trained CNN model (e.g., FER2013 dataset)



üóÉÔ∏è Dataset
This project uses the FER-2013 dataset for training the model. You can download it from Kaggle.
